## What need to be true for this project to succeed

- Produce income for specialiced profesionals of reforestation and conservation.
- Create economic incentives for reforestation and conservation

## Enforce good behavior

#### Minting

Our Partner Greenstand has implemented a system to verify plantations https://greenstand.org/

Only organizations verified with long term plans of reforestation and conservation will be able to mint NFTrees

#### Conservation

Our partnerships with space4good and Regen network will be able to report bad practices, monitor the plantation and.

#### Tokenization

we are working on the financial model to ensure that the economic incentives are align and produce the nexts outcomes:

- Insurance mechanism to safe or replant the trees
- Most of the cost of tree plantation are during the first three years, after those three years the costs are almost zero.
- Part of the revenue will be reinvested in R+D to make the system more secure and implement better monitoring systems.
- Onsite and telematic supervision.
- Incentives to have specialized communities doing onsite conservation.

## Risk assessment

### Challenges

- CO2 marketplace connections
- Adoption and public interest to make it economically sustainable. We are investigating ways to make it modular that we can build products on top like games or other more engaging products.

### Risks

- Not enough funds to finance the development
- Not able to find methods to certify planters and lose credibility

### Strengths

- Great team and advisors
- Big community backing the project
- Great interest in the general public to engage with regenerative/ sustainability projects
